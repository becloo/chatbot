# chatbot

Chatbots boost operational efficiency and bring cost savings to businesses while offering convenience and added services to internal employees and external customers. They are primarily used to provide customer support by communicating with a target audience in their language.

The advantages of a chatbot in an organization are vast, as they help companies get to know their customers, can be used as a selling machine, encourage customer service at any time, and improve customer satisfaction.

In this short project, I am experimenting and producing my first version of a chatbot. I utilized an intents json file, tokenizers, and neural networks to accomplish this. Other improved versions will be shared soon.
